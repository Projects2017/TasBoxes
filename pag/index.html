						<p>In 2008/2009 - once the dust started to settle after the biggest financial market crash ever  - I was burned out. I had lost some money (as did everyone else) and I decided for myself that I had to go back to the drawing board and develop a better set of tools to give me an edge to outdo and outsmart the market...</p><p style="color: rgb(92, 157, 75); text-align:center; font-size:44px; line-height:48px;"><b>I simply felt that I needed to do better…for myself.</b> </p>

					</div>
						
						
						
						<p>In 2012, after years of research and development I introduced a proprietary methodology of indicators. I named this set of indicators the TAS Market Suite of Indicators. TAS because is was meant to put my trading on autopilot. TAS = Trade Automation Software. </p><p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px; line-height:34px;"><b>No more guessing…that is what it was all about for me.</b> </p>

<p>By all accounts, this proprietary indicator set, called the TAS Market Indicator suite has been and continues to <i>revolutionize and aid  the trading style of thousands of professional Money Managers, Hedge Fund Managers and Instructional Trading Firms.</i>  (remember what I said earlier?)</p>

<p>The TAS Indicator suite, designed and owned by me, is currently only available through the Bloomberg Terminal. If you ever wonder why the average investor looses while the professional wins… 
</p>

<p>
Here is a reason:</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline; text-align:center; font-size:30px; line-height:38px;">The Annual Cost To receive the TAS Market Indicator Suite via Bloomberg is At Least : </p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; text-align:center; font-size:30px; line-height:38px; color:red; ">$30,000.00</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:34px; line-height:38px;">Yes…you read that right. It does equate the cost of Pick Up Truck.</p>

<p>So…since about 2012 my indicator set is being used by Hedge Fund Managers, Bank traders and big Money Management firms.</p>
<p>The TAS indicator suite helps them to analyze any stock and futures market in real time.  </p>
<p>It is a fantastic solution for true Market Professionals who have access to the latest technology and where money and costs are no problem.</p>

<p><h4><span style="padding:7px; background-color: rgb(0, 116, 199); ">I am here to tell you that I created something better for you.</span></h4></p><p><b> What I created  builds on the TAS Indicators I explained above…but it  takes it even further and represents a very significant step in addressing your individual needs you have an  investor and trader.</b></p>  

</p>

<p>Now…before I go any further ….I want you to know that I am not suggesting you spend anything close to the amount professional traders pay to get access to my methods.  As a matter of fact…the product I am about to introduce to you is considered lunch money by most people.
</p>

<p>Let me introduce you to...</p>

<p>I developed trading maps with sole intent to enable the private investor to be on a level playing field with the users of my services on the Bloomberg Terminal.</p>

<p>What I realized over the years is that every investor needs to have a few “Must Haves”  at his or her disposal to maneuver and succeed in the market. </p>

<p>When I developed Trading Maps I made sure that those “Must Haves” are checked off.  
</p>
<div style="line-height:29px !important;">
<ul style="font-size:23px;line-height:30px; ">
<li>My first goal was  that Trading Map needed to be easy to use and the signals have to be instantaneously recognizable. Easy To Spot!</li>
<li>My second goal was any signal must not be subject to interpretation (should I buy or sell?).  Not Subject To Interpretation</li>
<li>he third  goal was that Trading Maps had to level the playing field for its subscribers….it simply could not cost   30,000.00 US-$ per year. Affordable!</li>  
<li>The fourth goal is perhaps the most important one…I needed to come up with something which would only deliver the right opportunity at the right moment in time. Individual investors lack the time and resources to scan hundreds of stocks, in real time,  to focus on the perfect opportunity. <u>I needed to create something which would do it for them…like their own “Personal Assistant”.</u> </li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Trading Maps is based upon an analysis technique which is called Market Profile. It was originally developed by a legendary trader by the name of Peter Steidlmayer (one of the all time greats of the Chicago Trading Pits). I worked with Peter for more than 10 years. I worked with him shoulder to shoulder, in the same office …for almost 5 years.</p><p> Peter is now successfully retired…and to this day I owe him a debt of gratitude….he has taught me things no one else would have been able to.</p>

<div id="johnBox2"> 
<p style="color:rgb(0, 116, 199);">John Says:</p><p></p>
<p style="color:rgb(0, 116, 199); font-size:15px;">"I believe there are now so many indicators -- all of which are just a variation of the interpretation of prior price -- that there is little or no advantage to be gained by using anything which is based on conventional technical indicators and analysis." </p></div>

<p>Every chart and indicator you look at is an expression of how price moves through time. With the progress of time, a new bar chart or indicator dot is plotted Traders use that visual representation to enter or exit trades. </p>
<p>What that means though is that we all use the same concept of time and price to visualize our trades Every indicator is based upon the same concept. 99% (or more) of all technical trades are based on this concept.  In short, 99% of traders use the same baseline information to trade. The basic information is the same…every trader relies on the relationship of price and time to analyze and trade. </p>

<p>There is no advantage or edge to be gained this way. Everyone does the same. </p>

<p>I won’t bore you with the intricacies of how Market Profile is being calculated…..but just for comparisons…I have shown below an abstract of a market Profile chart versus a conventional bar chart. </p>

<p>Trading Map uses these unique price levels, generated based upon Market Profile Analysis, to calculate true turning points in the market. </p>

<p>A good way to think about is that Market Profile adds a third dimension to the conventional 2 dimensional way to analyze the market.  </p>

<p>So…if you are wondering - What’s the big deal here….let me introduce you to some eye popping numbers. </p>
<p>In our calculations we track the volume flows of the stocks we cover on a tick by tick, minute by minute basis. We then calculate, based upon the unique combination of  price, time and volume very  unique levels of support and resistance. These  support and resistance levels form the basis of our trade recommendations. </p>

<div id="johnBox2"> 
<p style="color:rgb(0, 116, 199);">Number Crunching</p><p></p>
<p style="color:rgb(0, 116, 199); font-size:15px;">We run these calculations simultaneously on all of the S&P 500 stocks,  all Nasdaq 100 stocks and an additional 4000 + financial instruments on overseas exchanges. <br /><br />In order to run these  calculations we need server banks which are the equivalent of at least 20 high end home computers. The server banks run in tandem and crunch huge amounts of data at any moment. The data then gets backed up and all calculations are mirrored to a remote site.</p></div>



<p>So…if you ever wondered why Wall Street guys have an edge…the above should give you an idea as to why. The data assembly, formula building  and processing power needed  cannot be duplicated by an individual investor. </p>

<p>Perhaps you are wondering why anyone would go through an effort like this, collect these massive amounts of data, scan close to 5000 stocks in real time and use these huge resources?</p>

<p>Pretty simple…it does tend to work.</p>
<p>The reason why we track a total of 5000 financial instruments on a tick by tick basis is that we want to find only those high quality stocks which exactly meet our requirements at the exactly right moment in time.   I am sure you have heard the term </p>

<p>Well…that is exactly what we are doing here.  As a matter of fact, I  can  not think of a better way to describe what makes Trading Map so unique. It literally is designed to find the right stock, with the right set up at the exactly right moment in time. If you consider  the vast number of stock movements at any moment in time -- <u>it truly does equate finding a small needle in a rather big haystack.</u> </p>

 <p>The scanning and real time number crunching is what makes Trading Map stand out from everything else. Instead of you having to do the manual labor of looking at individual stocks (not that you ever physically could look at that many stocks)  and find the right opportunity…we do it for you. We do it day in and day out…every second of the day. </p>  

<p>Trading Map is all about selection. Only the best possible trade set ups are the ones which will make the list. Those are the ones you will concentrate on as a user of our services.</p>

						<p>When I designed Trading Maps I was very much aware of some of pitfalls every investor is facing.</p>

<p>I have seen countless times the next best analysis software which was so complicated and cumbersome to use that it rendered itself useless.  I always like to say that one needs  a degree in the Application of Technical Indicators in order to make use of even a simple Moving Average system.</p> 

<p>Some people like to make things complicated…I do not.</p>

<p>Just take a look below….the way Trading Maps  provide you the  price entry and where you should place a protective stop is exactly as it is shown below. You have precise levels where to get into the trade and where your protective stop order should be. All what you need to do after the entry into the trade is lean back and let he trade work for you.</p>

<p>If you ever wondered how a precision entry should look…I think the real life examples below gives you a pretty good understanding of how it should be.</p> 


<p>One question I want to address with you is </p>

<p>In order to need money you will need to cash in on your winners at some point. I am a big believer in letting your winners run. As a matter of fact…the longer you run your winners ….the better off you will be over the long run.</p>

<p>But…the question of where to book profits is an important one to consider. No one has ever gone bankrupt by booking profits…and therefor you need to book profits too.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right:50px;color:blue;"><b><u>The beauty of Trading maps is that there is always another good trade opportunity waiting in the wings. If you get out of a trade prematurely or miss an opportunity today…all what you have to do is wait for tomorrow and chances are there will be another winner tomorrow (you can expect anywhere from 2 to 10 trade set ups a day).</u></b></p>

<p>Because of  as steady stream of reliable high percentage set ups you actually have quite a bit of freedom as to how you would like to manage your exits.</p>

<p>In order to provide you some guidance…here is how I do it:</p>

<p>You see…I hate losers and losing money. I hate drawdowns in my account..and I do everything to eliminate them or keep them as shallow as possible.</p>

<p>There are a few rules I follow to max out my winning percentage, avoid excessive drawdowns and in the unfortunate even that I take a loss….the loss does not hurt me.</p>

<p>Rule # 1:   I use a Money Management Strategy to raise my overall winning percentage. The way it works is that I exit half of my position at  a profit point which equals the amount of stop price. This provides me a risk free trade. This way I can let the profits run without having to worry about the trade ever becoming a looser.  As an example…I buy 100 IBM shares at 171.17. My stop is at 169.87  ( a potential loss of $ 1.30 per share)…I will get out of 50 shares (half my position) at a price point 1.30 above my entry. (price of 172.47 in this example). This simple strategy dramatically reduces my losing percentage. As I said before…I hate loosing money, this simple money management exit ensure that I avoid excessive drawdowns.  </p>

<p>Rule # 2: Once I am out of 50 % of the stock I concentrate on managing the trade. Generally speaking I look to take a profit which is at least 3 to 5 times greater than the initial stop. </p>

<p>Rule # 3: If the stock is in a running mode (making new highs every day in a case where I am long or new lows in a case where I am short) I will simply raise my stop below the previous day’s low and follow the market up.</p>

<p>The rules described above are the ones which work for me. They suit my personality and trading style. They work for me. </p>
However…different people have different styles…I encourage you to use what works for you.  As long as you have some patience to let your winners run…you will be ok. </p>

<p>The beauty of Trading Maps is that you are not limited in the number of available, high quality set ups. It is precisely because we scan thousands of stocks in real time and only focus on those which fire on all cylinders that for the first time in your investment life you might finally have a true verifiable edge.

<p>As a matter of fact…a lot of our clients who rely on our signals use options very much exclusively. There are a few reasons why option work so well with Trading Maps but the single most important one is the relationship of our Entry Stop (initial Risk) to the Potential Reward. </p>

<p>Due to the exponential nature of how options work  (the deeper they are in the money…the more money you make) a successful option trade is significantly more profitable than the same trade set up being traded with a stock.</p>

<p>As an example…take a look at a scenario shown below. This is a real life example of a signal in Tesla just this December. </p>

<p>The initial risk of that trade was about 400 US-$ on the stock trade and about $ 200  for the Option trade (this is due to the mechanics of how an option trade works) Look for yourself   how the final results differ versus the capital invested.</p>


<p>[chart image etc]</p>

	 

<p>As you can see…the option trade produced a return on your initial investment of more than 167 %...versus the stock trade generating about 15 %.
This is obviously a huge difference in return on capital invested. </p>
<p>If you have never traded options before you will obviously need to familiarize yourself with the mechanics of options trading. </p>

<p>And just to be clear…. I am  not recommending that you start option trading. My signals are good enough that they stand for themselves. There is no need for you to start trading options to make money. However…if you are familiar with options trading and if you wonder if you can use Trading Maps to provide reliable signals…the answer is yes. Trading Maps is ideally suited to provide all the signals you ever need to trade options.</p>
